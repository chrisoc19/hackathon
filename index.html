        The methods of embalming, or treating the dead body, that the ancient Egyptians used is called mummification.
        Using special processes, the Egyptians removed all moisture from the body, leaving only a dried form that would
        not easily decay. It was important in their religion to preserve the dead body in as life-like a manner as
        possible. So successful were they that today we can view the mummified body of an Egyptian and have a good idea
        of what he or she looked like in life, 3000 years ago.

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Ancient Egyptians believed that when a person died they made a journey to the next world. They believed that in order to live in the next world their body had to be preserved. A preserved body is called a mummy. While elaborate
                        versions of this practice were only reserved for the highest levels of Egyptian society, mummification was a cornerstone of Egyptian religion. After death a body begins to decompose. In order to prevent a body from decomposing
                        it is necessary to deprive the tissues of moisture and oxygen. The earliest Egyptians buried their dead in shallow pits in the desert. The hot, dry sand quickly removed moisture from the dead body and created a natural mummy. However,
                        the Egyptians discovered that if the body was first placed in a coffin, it would not be preserved. In order to ensure that the body was preserved the Ancient Egyptians began to use a process called mummification to produce their
                        mummies. This involved embalming the body and then wrapping it in thin strips of linen.

<h2>5. The Mummy's Tomb (1942)</h2>
<img src="images_movies/img5.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h3>Director: Harold Young</h3>
<p>The Mummy’s Tomb is a direct sequel to The Mummy’s Hand with the same group of heroes (although Wallace Ford’s character is now call Babe Hanson instead of Babe Jenson) returning for a rematch with Kharis. This Universal Mummy film (the studio’s third) stands out because Lon Chaney Jr. stepped into the wrapping, becoming the only actor to play Dracula (well, the Son of Dracula), Frankenstein’s Monster, the Wolf Man, and the Mummy for the studio.</p>

<h2>4. The Mummy (1999)</h2>
<img src="images_movies/img4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h3>Director: Stephen Sommers</h3>
<p>1999’s remake in name only of Universal’s original Mummy has one of the most fascinating production stories in the history of monster films. When Universal first decided to remake The Mummy, they turned to Clive Barker who reportedly crafted a very dark and sensual tale of time, lost love, and death (and a movie I would give me left arm to see). The story goes that Barker could not get on the same page as the studio and dropped out so Universal turned to George Romero.</p>



<h2>3. The Mummy (1959)</h2>
<img src="images_movies/img3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h3>Director: Terrence Fisher</h3>
<p>Moody as hell, Hammer’s first Mummy film returned the monster to greatness after the Universal Mummy cycle fell in quality during the Chaney pictures. This film stars Christopher Lee as the Mummy (Hammer resurrected the name Kharis for their opening Mummy salvo) and Peter Cushing as his adversary, John Banning.</p>

<h2>2. Bubba Ho-Tep (2003)</h2>
<img src="images_movies/img2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h3>Director: Don Coscarelli</h3>
<p>The most original, strangest, and oddly endearing mummy film ever made, 2003’s Bubba Ho-Tep starred the man himself Bruce Campbell as an (get ready for this) aged Elvis Presley who faked his own death and now lives in an East Texas rest home. Elvis must defend his home and fellow elderly housemates from a soul-sucking mummy, whom Elvis dubs Bubba Ho-Tep.</p>

<h2>1. The Mummy (1932)</h2>
<img src="images_movies/mummykarloff.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h3>Director: Karl Freund</h3>
<p>This mummy, the original mummy, was a tragic monster in the same vein as Frankenstein and unlike most mummies that came after, Karloff’s Imhotep was no mindless beast. No, Imhotep was a magic user and a thinker, an immortal creature that used guile and shadow to inflict his will. And he did it all for love. He believed that the lovely Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann) was the reincarnation of his lost love Ankh-es-en-amon.

This idea of a mummy seeking his time lost love would be repeated many times in future creature features but never with such tragic class as Universal original Mummy. It’s amazing that the popular mummy look, the bandaged ghoul that has appeared in so many films, was inspired by a scene that only lasted minutes; a precious few minutes where Karloff wore the wrappings that inspired almost a century of nightmares.</p>
