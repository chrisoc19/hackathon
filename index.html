        The methods of embalming, or treating the dead body, that the ancient Egyptians used is called mummification.
        Using special processes, the Egyptians removed all moisture from the body, leaving only a dried form that would
        not easily decay. It was important in their religion to preserve the dead body in as life-like a manner as
        possible. So successful were they that today we can view the mummified body of an Egyptian and have a good idea
        of what he or she looked like in life, 3000 years ago.
