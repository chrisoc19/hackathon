                <h1>Top 5 Mummy Movies</h1>
					<h2>5. The Mummy's Tomb (1942)</h2>
					<img src="images_movies/img5.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
					<h3>Director: Harold Young</h3>
					<p>The Mummy’s Tomb is a direct sequel to The Mummy’s Hand with the same group of heroes (although
						Wallace Ford’s character is now call Babe Hanson instead of Babe Jenson) returning for a rematch
						with Kharis. This Universal Mummy film (the studio’s third) stands out because Lon Chaney Jr.
						stepped into the wrapping, becoming the only actor to play Dracula (well, the Son of Dracula),
						Frankenstein’s Monster, the Wolf Man, and the Mummy for the studio.</p>

					<h2>4. The Mummy (1999)</h2>
					<img src="images_movies/img4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
					<h3>Director: Stephen Sommers</h3>
					<p>1999’s remake in name only of Universal’s original Mummy has one of the most fascinating
						production stories in the history of monster films. When Universal first decided to remake The
						Mummy, they turned to Clive Barker who reportedly crafted a very dark and sensual tale of time,
						lost love, and death (and a movie I would give me left arm to see). The story goes that Barker
						could not get on the same page as the studio and dropped out so Universal turned to George
						Romero.</p>



					<h2>3. The Mummy (1959)</h2>
					<img src="images_movies/img3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
					<h3>Director: Terrence Fisher</h3>
					<p>Moody as hell, Hammer’s first Mummy film returned the monster to greatness after the Universal
						Mummy cycle fell in quality during the Chaney pictures. This film stars Christopher Lee as the
						Mummy (Hammer resurrected the name Kharis for their opening Mummy salvo) and Peter Cushing as
						his adversary, John Banning.</p>

					<h2>2. Bubba Ho-Tep (2003)</h2>
					<img src="images_movies/img2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
					<h3>Director: Don Coscarelli</h3>
					<p>The most original, strangest, and oddly endearing mummy film ever made, 2003’s Bubba Ho-Tep
						starred the man himself Bruce Campbell as an (get ready for this) aged Elvis Presley who faked
						his own death and now lives in an East Texas rest home. Elvis must defend his home and fellow
						elderly housemates from a soul-sucking mummy, whom Elvis dubs Bubba Ho-Tep.</p>

					<h2>1. The Mummy (1932)</h2>
					<img src="images_movies/mummykarloff.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
					<h3>Director: Karl Freund</h3>
					<p>
						This mummy, the original mummy, was a tragic monster in the same vein as Frankenstein and unlike
						most mummies that came after, Karloff’s Imhotep was no mindless beast. No, Imhotep was a magic
						user and a thinker, an immortal creature that used guile and shadow to inflict his will. And he
						did it all for love. He believed that the lovely Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann) was the
						reincarnation of his lost love Ankh-es-en-amon.

						This idea of a mummy seeking his time lost love would be repeated many times in future creature
						features but never with such tragic class as Universal original Mummy. It’s amazing that the
						popular mummy look, the bandaged ghoul that has appeared in so many films, was inspired by a
						scene that only lasted minutes; a precious few minutes where Karloff wore the wrappings that
						inspired almost a century of nightmares.
